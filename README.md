# TODO
## TODO NEST BACKEND API PROJECT
This ✅ Todo API project is a RESTful backend application built with NestJS ⚙️ and MongoDB 🛢️, designed to demonstrate clean architecture, modular design, and best practices in backend development. It allows users to create todos with a title and optional description, update their completion status ✍️, retrieve single or multiple tasks 📋, and delete them when no longer needed.

The project leverages NestJS’s powerful module–controller–service structure to ensure scalability and maintainability, while MongoDB provides flexible and efficient data persistence for task records. Environment-based configuration 🔐 is used to manage sensitive settings like database connection strings, keeping the codebase secure and production-ready. All endpoints were thoroughly tested using Postman 📬 to validate request handling, data flow, and error responses.

Overall, this project serves as a solid example of how to build a clean, testable, and extensible backend API with NestJS 🚀—ideal for learning, showcasing backend skills, or extending into a full-stack application.
